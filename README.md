# Kepler

A small TCP server written in Java powered by Netty, an asynchronous networking library. Kepler is a Habbo Hotel emulator that is designed to fully emulate the v14 version from 2007 era, and upwards. The server is written in Java (JDK 11) and it's using various libraries, which means it's multiplatform, as in supports a wide range of operating systems. Windows, Linux distros, etc.

The server has many features added, and a lot of configuration settings. Most of the configuration settings will be explained below. This server supports version v9 through to v26, and different clients can connect at once, by the server configuration generated. Its support of v9 and v26 are completely experiental, but the full support is of v14, v15 and v21.
